# Photometric-Stereo

I have applied Photometric Stereo as a part of my MS Research work on 3D fingerprint reconstruction. I have applied the Photometric Stereo on both simulated and real world Data.

For applying the Photometric Stereo on the real-world objects and finger, I designed a camera and light setup and did the required calibration to obtain the 3D of the fingerprints.

The research is still ongoing in refining the outputs against specularity and sub-surface scattering in finger skin.
Following are the intermediate results:

Also the Global Shape of finger is being obtained via Parametric modeling
